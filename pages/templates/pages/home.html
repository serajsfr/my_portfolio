            <h4>My Django Projects</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              After starting my first course about Django, I tried to create a
              <a href="https://github.com/serajsfr/monthly_challenges"
                >monthly_challenges</a
              >
              app in which there are months of year and each month is linked to
              its challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a month of studying Django, I dived deeper into its concepts
              and made
              <a href="https://github.com/serajsfr/mysite">ads</a>
              app in which there are ads that users can create and comment on
              each. They can only edit/delete their own ads and comments. They
              can star their facorite ad if they want to.
            </p>
            <p>
              My recent project is
              <a href="https://github.com/serajsfr/project_management"
                >project_management</a
              >
              app in which there are tasks that users can see if they are
              completed, in progress, or pending. Each user can edit/delete
              their own tasks. I used Django Restful API in this project which
              was really helpful to understand more about this framework.

            <h4>My Experience as a Developer</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              I used to develop apps for mobile devices using Flutter. I've got
              an internship in a company in Tehran as a Flutter Developer and
              I've been coding there for seven months. But after sometime I
              realized that Flutter is not my thing. So I chose backend
              development over app development.

            <h4>How I Learn</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              I watch different courses and tutorials online to improve my
              skills and knowledge as a backend developer. I sometimes read
              books to understand some concepts better, so I can use them in my
              daily work. I ask friends and different communities when I face
              problems so I can learn better.

            <h4>My Short Term Goals</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
                I want to make my hands dirty with Django by doing different projects with different levels of difficulty. This helps me to become expert in problem solving and coding techniques, so I can be a better backend developer in the future.
